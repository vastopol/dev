Graphviz

NOTE: each TreeNode contains a "key" value which is a unique character used to generate the .dot file.

Graphviz Dot files - graphs represented in .dot file can be displayed int the Graphviz viewer called dotty.
We will call dotty of a .dot file from within your C++ program using the system call.
But first familiarize yourself with both the input file format and the corresponding output using the dotty viewer.
