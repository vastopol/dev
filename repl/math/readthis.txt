Removed the old arithmetic expression tree stuff)
should do it proper:

First fix and clean on srich009 side
    - CS14 lab5 (arithhmetic expression tree)
    - CS100 lab4 (compositional, structural stuff for tree eval)
    
then clone over here and improve,

then integrate the two for a POSTFIX calculator language like RPL or FORTH
