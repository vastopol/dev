9.2 Regular Expressions

An implementation of a subset of the full regular expression language and program grep.
Only the meta characters are: '^', '$', '.', and '*'

It is conventional that C programs return 0 for success, and non-zero values for various failures.
this version of grep defines success as finding a matching line, it returns 0 if there were any matches,
returns 1 if there were none, and returns 2 if there was an error. These status values can bes tested by other programs.

the main routine doesn't quit if it fails to open a file.
This was chosen because it is common to find that one of the files in the directory cant be read.
grep keeps going after reporting the problem. 

grep prints the file name and the matching line, but suppresses the name if it is reading the standard input or a single file.
this reflects an idomatic style of use, when given only one input, grep's task is usually selection,
and the file name would clutter the output, but if it is asked to search through many files, the task is most often to
find all occurances of something, and the names are informative.

ex.

$ strings file.txt | grep 'message'

or

$ grep expr file*.txt
