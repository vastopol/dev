program strings is for looking at files of mostly non-printable characters.
there is often information inside of these documents.
strings can be helpful for finding text in other binary files.

unix systems provide an implementation of strings already.
it is implemented differently than this example, the unix version recognizes
when its input is a program and examines only the text and data segments ignoring the symbol table.
it's -a option forces it to read the whole file.

strings extracts the ascii text form a binary file so that the text can be read or processed by other programs.
if an error message carries no identification, it may not be evident what program produced it, or why.
searching through likely directories with 
    $ strings *.exe *.dll | grep 'message'
might locate the producer of the message

strings does not read its standard input if no files are specified.
