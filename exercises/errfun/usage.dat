error handling library functions

for example: eprintf()

this function behaves like fprintf(stderr, ...) but it exits the program
with an error status after reporting the error. it uses the <stdarg.h> header
and also the vfprintf library routine to print the ... in the prototype. 
the stdarg library must be initialized by a call to va_start and terminated by a call to va_end.

if the format argument ends with a colon, eprintf calls the standard C function strerror,
which returns a string containing any additional system error information that might be available.

weprintf is similar to eprintf but displays a warning and does not exit (not included ***)

estrdup tries to make a copy of a string and exits with a message (via eprintf) if it runs out of memory

emalloc provides a similar service for calls to malloc
