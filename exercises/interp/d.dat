not a full implementation, would need a parser for this to work.
also would have to complete the rest of the operations and build a framework.

//-----------------------------------------

for the statement:

a = max(b, c/2);

parse tree:

     (=)
    /   \
  (a)   (max)
        /   \
      (b)   (/)
            /  \
          (c)  (2)

generated code from part 3:

pushsymop
b
pushsymop
c
pushop
2
divop
maxop
storesymop
a
